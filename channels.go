/*Channels are a way to communicate between goroutines in Go. They allow you to send and receive values between goroutines, allowing them to synchronize their execution and share data.
Here is a simple example of how to use channels in Go:
*/

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// Create a channel to send integers.
	ch := make(chan int)

	// Launch a goroutine that sends the value 1 to the channel.
	go func() {
		ch <- 1
	}()

	// Read a value from the channel.
	value := <-ch
	fmt.Println("Received value:", value)
}

/*
In this example, we create a channel using the make function. This channel is used to send integers. Then, we launch a goroutine that sends the value 1 to the channel using the <- operator. Finally, we read a value from the channel using the <- operator, and print it out.
Channels are a powerful way to synchronize and communicate between goroutines. They can be used to send and receive any type of value, and they have built-in support for synchronization and blocking. This makes them a useful tool for building concurrent programs in Go.
It's worth noting that channels have a direction, which can be either send or receive. This means that you can create a channel that can only be used to send values, or a channel that can only be used to receive values. This can be useful for controlling the flow of data between goroutines.
